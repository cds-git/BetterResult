# BetterResult
Just my personal implementation of the result pattern to get better understanding of it.

## TODO:
- Add XML comment documentation
- Add example usage to README
- Add extensive testing
- Add operations to the base result class
- Add helper methods for interacting with metadata in erorrs
    - Add, Remove, Override, Extract by type
